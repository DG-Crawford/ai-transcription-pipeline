# AI Transcription Pipeline

This respository demonstrates a local AI transcription workflow using OBS, WhisperX, and optional text post-processing tools. Attempts to reflect best practices in open-source documentation, modular CLI scripting, reproducible pipelines, docs-as-code mindset, and privacy-aware preprocessing.

## Features

- Uses `.mkv` recordings from OBS Studio
- Transcribes audio using WhisperX with diarization support
- Optional keyword and pattern cleanup (redaction)

## Workflow Overview

1. Record using OBS
2. Run `transcribe_obs_auto.ps1` to:
   - Convert `.mkv` to `.wav`
   - Transcribe using WhisperX
   - Output transcript into a subfolder
3. (Optional) Run `redactor.py` to clean names, IPs, versions, and more as directed in the Optional Cleanup section below.

## Usage

### 1. Transcription

Run from PowerShell:

```powershell
.	transcribe_obs_auto.ps1
```

- Prompts for OBS recording folder
- Automatically processes the latest `.mkv`
- Uses WhisperX with Hugging Face diarization support

Dependencies:

- `ffmpeg` (in PATH)
- `whisperx` installed
- Hugging Face token available via `$env:HF_TOKEN`

### 2. Optional Cleanup

Run from Python:

```bash
python redactor.py transcript.txt
```
- Insert your transcript file name after redactor.py
- Replaces names, domains, IPs, and version strings listed in `keywords.txt` with `[REDACTED]` 
- Outputs: `transcript.redacted.txt`

## Summarizer Module (Prototype)

This optional script (included separately) attempts to summarize transcripts using a local LLM (e.g., Mistral 7B).

Current/planned features:

- Transcript chunking for token window management
- Debugging support and structured output (WIP)
- Summary generation via local models

Limitations:

- Early-stage prototype
- Local-only; no API integration
- Not yet production-ready

This module is included to demonstrate forward-looking architecture and AI integration potential.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Summarizer: bullet summaries with context window management
- [ ] Web-based transcript viewer
- [ ] Diarization parser and speaker tag refinements
- [ ] Optional pre-trimming based on silence or voice activity
- [ ] Modularize WhisperX options into a config file
- [ ] Maybe serve markdown docs via MkDocs Material

## Privacy Note

No data is uploaded or stored externally. All processing happens locally on your machine. Redaction and summarization are optional modules and can be excluded from the workflow entirely.
